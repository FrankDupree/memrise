# Memrise Console Quiz App

[![N|Solid](http://codeniro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/codeniro_small.png)](http://codeniro.com)

The memrise quiz app is based on one of my sneaky attempts to learn chinese through the command prompt without having to load the memrise homepage on a browser and have the whole team yell at me thinking i'm slacking off :(.  Now everyone simply assumes I'm running some npm or linux commands :D. &ast;laughs evilly&ast;

Turns out it could be a useful way of learning foreign languages from memrise or any other language teaching service. Note that this isn't a replacement for the memrise app/website, more like a complement.

### Installation

Memrise quiz app requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3 to run.

```sh
$ cd memrise
$ python app.py
```

Follow the instructions on the screen and you should be good to go.
